DataTypeConverter
=================

This converter essentially does reinterpret casting between types. So, the actual binary value stored in memory does not change, but the bits are interpeted as float, int, hex, etc.

I will also be adding other functionality as needed: unix time conversion, ascii conversion, etc.

To use it, simply load index.html
